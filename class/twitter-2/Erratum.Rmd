## Load packages

You should start with loading and installing packages in this script. There is a new package called `lubidate` which needs to be installed.

```{r load_packages}
## Install packages for text analysis
packages <- c("lubridate")
install.packages(packages)

## Load packages needed in this script
library(rtweet) # for downloading data from Twitter
library(dplyr) # for data transformation
library(magrittr) # for data transformation
library(tidytext) # for text analysing
library(stringr) # for dealing with strings
library(wordcloud) # for basic text visualisation
library(ggplot2) # for graphics
library(DataCombine) # for data transformation
library(reshape2) # for data transformation
library(lubridate) # for dates manipulation
```


## Erratum

You need to create first object `FACup_sentiment` to be able to run the code below. In other words you need to execute chunk `transform_data` from `Twitter-2.Rmd`, and lines from 149 to 153 from the same script. To make up for the mistakes I made in original `Twitter-2.Rmd` I added match events to the visualization of the FACup game. If something is not clear let me know either on Wednesday or any other day you see me.

```{r erratum}
## Create data frame with match events
## In the first column there is time and in the second what happened.
match_events <- data_frame(time = c("18-01-06 15:00:00",
                                    "18-01-06 15:25:00",
                                    "18-01-06 15:45:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:00:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:11:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:13:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:26:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:37:00",
                                    "18-01-06 16:45:00") %>%
                             ## This is really important transformation. It transform vector above into date vector.
                             as_datetime(tz = NULL),
                           ## Second column
